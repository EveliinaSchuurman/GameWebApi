# Task 3 + 4
This is upsetting me dearly
It's half three in the morning, I've woken up to work at 6 am and when I say this course is not documented enough they tell me I'm 'lazy'. I'd like to see you try my schedule and tell me I'm *just not trying hard enough* when I'm on the verge of cutting again.

Funny how one can write whatever when you know the reader doesn't give a flying fuck.
